# Machine Learning First Project

This project has been done in order to obtain a Certificate in Computer Science. It was made by a ***beginner*** in both programming and Machine Learning, so any help or advice is welcome. In this project I used many libraries, functions and such that I found on the Internet either through official documentation, trial and error or from answered questions from other users.
 
With that being said, the project was created in ```Python v3.7.4``` with the following libraries using the ```Anaconda Distribution Platform v4.8.1```:
```
scikit-learn = v0.22.1
numpy = v1.17.4
time 
matplotlib = v3.1.2
opencv = v4.2.0
joblib = v0.14.1
```
